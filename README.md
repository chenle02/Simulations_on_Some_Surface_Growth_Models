# Simulations on Some Surface Growth Models

![Sticky Tetris](./tests/simulation/config_Tetris_Sticky.gif)

This repository contains simulations for various surface growth models,
developed initially as a final exam project for Math-7820 (Applied Stochastic
Processes I), Fall 2023 at Auburn University. It was further expanded as a
course project for Math-7830 (Applied Stochastic Processes II), Spring 2024.
More information about the courses can be found here: [Math-7820 Fall
2023](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~lzc0090/teaching/2023_Fall_Math7820/).

These simulations provide insights into the dynamics and characteristics of
surface growth processes, inspired by theoretical models and real-world
applications.
