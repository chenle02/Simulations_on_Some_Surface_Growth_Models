# Things to do
1. [  ] Write the main function and parsing the arguments for the program. Check [RD_CLI py](../RD_CLI.py) and [Visualize_RD py](../Visualize_RD.py).
   * Try `../RD_CLI.py --help` or `../Visualize_RD.py --help` to see how to use these functions
2. [  ] Clean up the codes, just keep one python script here. All functions will be integrated into the main function.
3. [  ] After the above two steps, we can start to design the experiments and batch run them and write the report.
