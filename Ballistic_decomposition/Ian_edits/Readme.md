# Things to do depending on the goal:
## To complete final exam project:
1. [ ] Write the main function and parsing the arguments for the program. Check [RD_CLI py](../RD_CLI.py) and [Visualize_RD py](../Visualize_RD.py).
   * Try `../RD_CLI.py --help` or `../Visualize_RD.py --help` to see how to use these functions
2. [ ] Clean up the codes, just keep one python script here. All functions will be integrated into the main function.
3. [ ] Write a technical report explaining the how to use the program. This can
   be put in the [Readme](Readme.md). I will start writing the readme.md file for my parts.

## More ambitious goal:
1. [ ] After the above two steps, we can start to design the experiments and batch run them and write the report.
   * The experiments and report can be done in the private submodule (invitation has been sent to you).


## Ideal ambitious goal:
1. [ ] Make literature review and complete the simulation paper. The paper can be submitted to some physics journals. I will also ask my colleagues for possible journals.
